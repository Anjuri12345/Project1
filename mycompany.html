<h2> <center> About this blog </center> </h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, 
is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence 
displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research 
is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives 
its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully
achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence"
is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans 
associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>

<h2> <center>Problems requiring AGI to solve</center></h2>
<p>The most difficult problems for computers are informally known as
"AI-complete" or "AI-hard", implying that solving them is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence, or strong AI, beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.[14]

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include general computer vision, natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.[15]

AI-complete problems cannot be solved with current computer technology alone, and also require human computation. This property can be useful to test for the presence of humans, as with CAPTCHAs, 
and for computer security to repel brute-force attacks.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<h4>AI is relevant to any intellectual task.[266] Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; 
this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.</h4>

<h4>HEALTH</h4>
<p>Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft
has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.</p>

<h4>AUTOMOTIVE</h4>
<p>Advancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles. As of 2016, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of driverless cars.
 A few companies involved with AI include Tesla, Google, and Apple.</p>

<h4> FINANCE AND AUTOMOTIVE</h4>
<p>Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards.
 Programs like Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services</p>

<h4>VIDEO GAMES</h4>
<p>In video games, artificial intelligence is routinely used to generate dynamic purposeful behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, well-understood AI techniques are routinely used for pathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a "solved problem" for most production tasks. Games with more atypical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead (2008) 
and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in Supreme Commander 2 (2010).</p>

<h4>MILITARY</h4>
<p>Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from 5.1 billion USD in 2010 to 7.5 billion USD in 2015. Military drones capable of autonomous action are widely considered a useful asset. In 2017, Vladimir Putin stated that "Whoever becomes the leader in (artificial intelligence) will become the ruler of the world". Many artificial intelligence 
researchers seek to distance themselves from military applications of AI. </p>

<h4>ADVERTISING</h4>
<p>A report by the Guardian newspaper in the UK in 2018 found that online gambling companies were using AI to predict the behavior of customers in order to target them with personalized promotions. Developers of commercial AI platforms are also beginning to appeal more directly to casino operators, offering a range of existing and potential services 
to help them boost their profits and expand their customer base.</p>

 and communicate with other AIs to increase their chances of victory.</p>

<p> The AI detailed in this article learned to play simple video games, and Google will be testing that same intelligence in driving games before moving onto the road. The idea is that, eventually, the car will be able to “look” at the road ahead of it and 
make decisions based on what it sees, helping it learn in the process. </p>

<p><strong>FRAUD DETECTION</strong></p>
<p> Have you ever gotten an email or a letter asking you if you made a specific purchase on your credit card? Many banks send these types of communications if they think there’s a chance that fraud may have been committed on your account, and want to make sure that you approve the purchase before sending money over to another company. Artificial intelligence 
is often the technology deployed to monitor for this type of fraud. </p>
